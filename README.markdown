## 🧠 About Me

I'm a backend-first engineer passionate about crafting **explicit, maintainable, and production-grade systems**. My expertise lies in building **state-aware workflows**, **real-time data pipelines**, and **operationally safe platforms** that eliminate silent failures and ensure reliability. I approach every project with a focus on **auditability**, **reproducibility**, and **future-proof design**, ensuring systems are robust and adaptable to evolving requirements.

I specialize in creating cost-efficient, scalable solutions that balance performance, budget, and resource constraints. From designing trigger-based job order systems to streaming Kafka pipelines for real-time analytics, I anticipate edge cases and prioritize operational clarity. My deployments span platforms like Heroku, Vercel, Render, and Hostinger, always optimized for sustainability and practicality.
