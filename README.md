Hi, I'm Mark 👋

  System Workflow Architect • Associate Data Engineer • Solutions Builder  



🧠 About Me
I'm a backend-first engineer passionate about crafting explicit, maintainable, and production-grade systems. My expertise lies in building state-aware workflows, real-time data pipelines, and operationally safe platforms that eliminate silent failures and ensure reliability. I approach every project with a focus on auditability, reproducibility, and future-proof design, ensuring systems are robust and adaptable to evolving requirements.
I specialize in creating cost-efficient, scalable solutions that balance performance, budget, and resource constraints. From designing trigger-based job order systems to streaming Kafka pipelines for real-time analytics, I anticipate edge cases and prioritize operational clarity. My deployments span platforms like Heroku, Vercel, Render, and Hostinger, always optimized for sustainability and practicality.

🎓 Certifications

🧪 Associate Data Engineer (DataCamp)Certified in designing scalable data pipelines, secure storage systems, and real-time analytics workflows. Demonstrated expertise in data modeling, ETL processes, and performance optimization.

📊 Data Engineering with Python (DataCamp)Mastered Python-based data engineering tools, including Pandas, PySpark, and Airflow, for building robust data pipelines and analytics systems.



💼 Experience & Mindset

Architected state-aware backend workflows with explicit transition logic to ensure operational safety and prevent silent failures.
Developed real-time data ingestion pipelines using Kafka, PySpark, and dashboard integrations for low-latency analytics.
Refactored complex PL/pgSQL stored procedures to handle edge cases, recursion, and schema evolution while maintaining performance.
Automated metrics population and reporting with conflict-safe upserts, deduplication logic, and scheduled tasks using pg_cron.
Designed systems with auditability, reproducibility, and operational clarity as core principles, ensuring transparency and reliability.
Optimized deployments for cost-efficiency across platforms like Heroku, Vercel, and AWS, balancing performance with budget constraints.

My mindset is rooted in pragmatic problem-solving—I build systems that are not only technically sound but also aligned with business goals and resource realities. I prioritize data security, privacy, and sustainability, ensuring every solution is robust, scalable, and maintainable.
